Exercise 13

Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate
and then generates them. (use functions)
Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers
where the next number in the sequence is the sum of
the previous two numbers in the sequence.
The sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
