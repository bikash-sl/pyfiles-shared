Exercise 30

This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series.
The other exercises are: Part 2(Guess Letters) and Part 3(Hangman).

In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word 
from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. 
Download this file(http://norvig.com/ngrams/sowpods.txt) and save it in 
the same directory as your Python code. 
This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in 
professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.
